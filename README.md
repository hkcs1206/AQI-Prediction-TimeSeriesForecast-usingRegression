# AQI-Prediction-TimeSeriesForecast-usingRegression

This project involves building regression models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on historical data. Four different models were trained and tested to find the best performing one.

The data used for this project is a time series dataset consisting of AQI values from different cities for the past few years. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
