# AQI-Prediction-TimeSeriesForecast-usingRegression

This project involves building regression models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on historical data. Four different models were trained and tested to find the best performing one.

The data used for this project is a time series dataset consisting of AQI values from different cities for the past few years. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

# Results
The R2 scores of each model on the test set are as follows:

* R2 score for Support Vector Regression (SVR) - 0.80
* R2 score for Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) - 0.84
* R2 score for Gradient Boosting Regression - 0.77
* R2 score for Random Forest Regression - 0.83
Based on the R2 scores, Multiple Linear Regression performed the best on this dataset.
